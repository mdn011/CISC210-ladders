# CISC210-ladders
Scholars of ladders only.

Story: CISC210-50
As a scholar of ladders, I would like to contribute to blog about different types of ladders so that I can study ladders by type, build, height, and number of steps.

I would like a badge or icon to indicate my level of expertise in ladders.
I would to navigate through the blog via a sidebar of some sort that is designed and has an aesthetic like a ladder.
I would like a link near the footer that will lead to a list of published, peer-reviewed articles about ladders.

Below is an application to become a scholar of ladders.

What was the height of the tallest ladder you've ever climbed? If you don't know, how high are you willing to climb a ladder?

What is the highest number of steps you've taken on a ladder?

Would you rather climb a metal ladder or a wooden one?
